Those programs aim to enhance early warning capabilities while implementing effective disaster reduction strategies.<br><br> The governance of those interconnected and interactive disasters often involves multiple central and local government departments. The effective integration of these government entities' functions and the establishment of inter-departmental communication platforms present significant challenges. <br><br>Despite various government units adapting to the digitalisation trend and developing platforms to address these challenges, the problems of dispersed data storage and non-standardized data formats severely hinder effective integration and interdepartmental communication. Moreover, improvements to existing platforms are still needed, including intelligent model development and maintenance, cross-domain interfaces, security management, dynamic and static data integration, and platform service provisions. <br><br>To bridge these gaps, this project proposes a smart disaster prevention platform that integrates the spatial information of environmental hydraulics, to cope with water-related disasters (such as debris flows, collapses and floods). Compared to sudden disasters like earthquakes, these disasters have higher predictability, making them ideal cases for developing smart application platforms. <br><br>The project aims to establish a cross- domain data platform that facilitates resource sharing and communication through the data integration and the continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) of artificial intelligence models, thereby enhancing disaster prediction and prevention capabilities. The key strategy is to standardize data and model integration approach for the establishment of an available, reliable and scalable platform. <br><br>The project will significantly improve Taiwan's ability to analyze and address complex potential causal factors to disasters. Additionally, it will assist the government in dealing with complex jurisdictional issues related to comprehensive disaster prevention, establishing a cross-domain foundational platform for collective discussion, and enhancing the efficiency of disaster response.",-

Without corresponding expertise in information technology and analytical reasoning, the potential benefits of such data cannot be effectively realized. Moreover, as global energy demands continue to rise, evaluating and mitigating the environmental and climatic impacts of energy systems remains an unavoidable challenge for human societies.<br><br> This project aims to establish a course series under the theme of 'Smart Human-Centric Environments'. Through an interdisciplinary exploration of climate, human environments, and energy systems, the initiative seeks to deepen the understanding of the interconnections and mutual influences among science, technology, and society. By offering training in data processing, analysis, and the development of statistical, mathematical, or machine learning models, the program aspires to nurture the next generation of professionals equipped with information-driven mindsets. These individuals will be capable of systematically analyzing and addressing complex issues across engineering, society, economy, energy, and the environment.<br><br> The project team primarily comprises faculty members from the Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) division of the Department of Civil Engineering at National Taiwan University (NTU). The CAE division has a long history of cultivating engineers and researchers with expertise in both engineering and information science. In recent years, the team has actively expanded its interdisciplinary faculty to cover domains such as materials science, meteorology and hydrology, transportation, and energy, in addition to its foundational strengths in structures and construction management.<br><br> The CAE division also maintains strong industry collaborations, contributing significantly to the digitalization and automation of civil engineering practices. In teaching, the division has extensive experience in information-related pedagogy and continuously integrates emerging technologies into its civil engineering curriculam. Over the past several years, the team has introduced core courses in artificial intelligence and data analytics, as well as application-focused courses tailored to engineering contexts.<br><br> Since the 2021 academic year, in alignment with NTU’s curriculum reform strategies, the project team has developed a specialization module in 'Smart Human-Centric Environments.' This module has progressively integrated and refined courses on AI, data analytics, and their applications, building a robust foundation of instructional expertise. The team is confident that its faculty and teaching experience are well-equipped to enhance this module further, transforming it into a flagship AI application curriculum. This upgraded module will serve as a model for dissemination by the Ministry of Education to other universities and high schools.",-

It aims to improve water quality in the UK and Taiwan by working with citizens to gather data, share knowledge and experiences, and develop new technologies.<br><br> Citizen Science (CS) is the active involvement of non-scientists in the generation of new scientific knowledge, from which they also stand to actively benefit[1]. As well as creation of new data, benefits can include:<br><br>● Achieving good governance through public participation.[2]<br>● Democratisation of science by bridging the gap between communities and professionals.[2] [3]<br>● Incorporation of local, traditional or indigenous knowledge.[3]<br>● Social learning and development of new skills.[3]<br>● Changing values, attitudes and behaviour.[3]<br><br>In Taiwan, citizen-driven air quality monitoring has yielded impressive results. The AirBox project, launched by Academia Sinica and LASS in 2015, has created low-cost air quality sensors in collaboration with citizens, with over 4,000 devices installed across Taiwan by the end of 2019[4].<br><br> AirBox data is now integrated into the Taiwanese government’s ‘forward-looking infrastructure-digital construction’ plan[4], and has been used to create assistive technologies for citizens, including a chat-bot for air quality alerts[5] and a pollution-free walking route app[6]. <br><br>As well as the technical expertise of the researchers working on the project, key to its success has been involvement of citizens at all stages of its development.Newcastle University are experts in mobilising citizen science to address water problems[2] [7]. RPS brings experience of working on water quality in the UK.<br><br> We want to combine Taiwanese expertise in working with citizens to create technology that delivers results with UK expertise in water to empower citizens in both countries to improve water quality.",https://research.ncl.ac.uk/upstream-tw/

It aims to resemble the physical process of rainfall using parameters with physical meanings. There are, however, two main challenges yet to be overcome in stochastic rainfall modelling. These are 1) reproduction of rainfall extremes at sub-hourly timescales, and 2) incorporation of the impact of climate change.<br><br> Some recent breakthroughs have been made to address the first challenge. Onof and Wang (2020) reformulated the equations of the randomised Bartlett-Lewis rectangular pulse (BLRPR) models and showed that the improved models can well preserving rainfall extremes at sub-hourly (5- and 10-min) and hourly timescales.The second challenge is however yet to be explored. Cross et al. (2020) presented a multivariate regression method that associates BLRPR parameters to temperature estimates on a monthly basis, attempting to capture the dynamics of the underlying climate. However, the concept of ‘calendar month’ - an artificial period of time - was still employed to represent natural seasonality. This may fail capturing the natural variations in seasonality between years. In addition, the use of regression may be insufficient to address some (nonlinear) hidden information due the large difference in scales. To address the above drawbacks, it is critical to ‘relax’ the concept of calendar month and to improve the way to associate the local rainfall properties with the co-located climate conditions.<br><br> Potential solutions to tackling the aforementioned challenges are proposed in this project. These include: 1) an innovative pre-processing approach that reduces the impact of the discrete nature of calendar month; 2) a machine-learning based method that associate climate variables with local rainfall properties through the identification of climate analogs using Dynamic Time Warping and k-Nearest Neighbour techniques; and, 3) a deep-learning based method that will be trained to predict local rainfall properties from input climate variables based upon a Neural Network with self-attention mechanism. The ‘predicted’ local rainfall properties will then be used as input into a Bartlett Lewis model for generating long-term fine timescale rainfall time series and, in turn, for extremal analyses.<br><br> Selected atmospheric variables (e.g. geopotential, temperature, U-component of wind, and V-component of wind) from the globally available public datasets (including ERA5 re-analysis and CORDEX datasets), as well as five-minute rainfall data from 5 long recording rain gauges in Germany (one with 69 years of data; others with 49 years) and from selected rain gauges in Taiwan, will be used for model development, testing and verification. In particular, the impact of incorporating climate variables into local rainfall modelling will be evaluated.<br><br> Finally, the CORDEX climate projections under various RCP (Representative Concentration Pathway) scenarios will be used to generate future high temporal resolution rainfall. This would provide insights on the impact of climate changes to future sub-hourly and hourly rainfall features over project pilots in Germany and Taiwan.",-

There are however two main deficiencies in the general practice. First, historical data from a given period is usually used, and its statistical properties are assumed to be stationary. This assumption is likely to be invalid. Recent studies show that the rapid climate change has resulted in an increasingly warmer climate condition, in turn, having caused changes in the frequency of extreme rainfall in many countries in the world. The changes are in particular evident when looking into rainfall extreme at fine timescales (i.e. hourly or finer). However, these studies mostly worked with time series data from individual gauges. Therefore, the impact of climate change to spatial structure of rainfall is rarely investigated.<br><br> This is relevant with the second deficiency in the practice, where the impact of the spatial variations in rainfall is commonly neglected in the design rainfall, which, has been demonstrated in the literature, may lead to under- or over-estimation of the subsequent hydrological calculation, particularly at urban scale applications.This project aims to address these two deficiencies through the development of a climate change enabled stochastic spatial-temporal rainfall generator. More specifically, we will take advantage of having the access to two collections of 10+ year high-resolution radar data archives from Taiwan and the UK, respectively. These long datasets will enable extracting detailed spatial and temporal rainfall properties, thus exploring the possibility of associating these properties with the variations in the underlying climate system. <br><br>The main outcome of this proposed project will be a climate change enabled stochastic spatial temporal rainfall generator that can be used to not only sample design storm events with realistic spatial and temporal features, but also incorporate the variations in the modelled climate variables resulting from various RCP (Representative Concentration Pathway) forcing scenarios into applications. The findings from this project would provide insights on the impact of climate changes to future rainfall properties, in both space and time, over project pilots in Taiwan and the UK.",https://www.grb.gov.tw/search/planDetail?id=14508222
