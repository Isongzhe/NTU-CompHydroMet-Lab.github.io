Given the dynamic and clustering nature of convective storms, object-based nowcasting has emerged as an effective approach, characterised by its ability to identify, track, and extrapolate their motion. These models excel in identifying rainfall objects in radar images and constructing their temporal associations. However, a critical limitation in many of existing methods lies in their lack of mechanism to incorporate the evolution of rain cell intensity into the nowcasting process.</p><p id="""">A recent study by Cheng et al. (2023) demonstrated the effectiveness of utilising convective core altitude – a property retrieved from three-dimensional radar data– to improve the prediction of the evolution of single-core convective cell lifecycle. Their results suggest that, compared to persistence nowcasts, the prediction errors in rainfall intensity can be reduced by 50% at 15-min forecast lead time. However, this model focused on predicting ‘mean’ cell properties, while promising, still falls short for operational forecasting.</p><p id="""">This research aims to enhance object-based nowcasting by developing methods to integrate the cell evolution model proposed by Cheng et al. (2023) with an operational positional forecasting model. A recent development of a Kalman filter based object-based convective storm nowcasting model, co-developed by researchers from several international sectors and the UK Met Office (Wang et al., 2022), is employed here for positional prediction of convective cells. The key challenge of the integration lies in producing spatial-distributed convective cell nowcasts and the associated evolution prediction uncertainty that can be incorporated with the positional prediction uncertainty under a Kalman filter framework. </p><p id="""">To tackle this challenge, we test on two approaches. Inspired by Shehu and Haberlandt (2022), the first approach employs a cell analog method to identify historical cells with similar mean properties predicted by the cell evolution model. Those cell analogs with high similarity are then used to empirically constitute prediction uncertainty. For the second approach, we generate spatially-distributed cells via fitting bivariate Gaussian or Exponential shape (Willems, 2001; Féral et al., 2003) models using predicted mean properties, which can further cell samples with similar mean properties. Two approaches will then be integrated with the positional nowcasting model, respectively. Probabilistic nowcasting will be undertaken to generate ensemble nowcasts that account for both positional and evolution variations. Ensemble members from each approach at each forecasting time step can constitute a convective storm ‘hazard’ map. We will indirectly evaluate the performance of two proposed approaches via assessing these hazard maps with radar observations. </p>",2024

It can be used to synthesise sufficiently long rainfall time series to support hydrological applications (such as sewer system design) or weather-related risk analysis (such as excess rainfall insurance product design). The Bartlett-Lewis (BL) rectangular pulse model is a type of stochastic model that represents rainfall using a Poisson cluster point process. It is calibrated with standard statistical properties of rainfall data (e.g. mean, coefficient of variation, skewness and auto-correlation and so on), but it can well preserve extreme statistics of rainfall at multiple timescales simultaneously. In addition, it is found to be less sensitive to observational data length than the existing rainfall frequency analysis methods based upon, for example, annual maxima time series, so it provides an alternative to rainfall extremes analysis when long rainfall datasets are not available. In this work, we would like to introduce an open source Python package for a BL model: pyBL, implemented based upon the state-of-the-art BL model developed in Onof and Wang (2020). In the pyBL package, the BL model is separated into three main modules. These are statistical properties calculation, BL model calibration and model sampling (i.e. simulation) modules. The statistical properties calculation module processes the input rainfall data and calculates its standard statistical properties at given timescales. The BL model calibration module conducts the model fitting based upon the re-derived BL equations given in Onof and Wang (2020). A numerical solver, based upon Dual Annealing optimization and Nelder-Mead local minimization techniques, is implemented to ensure the efficiency as well as to prevent from being drawn to local optima during the solving process. Finally, one can use the sampling module to generate stochastically rainfall time series at a given timescale and for any required data length, based upon a calibrated BL model.The design of the pyBL is highly modularized, and the standard CSV data format is used for file exchange between modules. Users could easily incorporate given modules into their existing applications. In addition, a team, consisting of researchers from National Taiwan University and Imperial College London, will consistently implement the new breakthroughs in BL model to the package, so users will have access to the latest developments. The package is now undergoing the final quality check and will be available on Github (https://github.com/NTU-CompHydroMet-Lab/pyBL) in due course.</p>",2021

It aims to resemble the physical process of rainfall using parameters with physical meanings, instead of its statistical features. There are, however, two main challenges yet to be overcome in stochastic rainfall modelling. These are 1) reproduction of rainfall extremes at sub-hourly timescales, and 2) incorporation of the impact of climate change.Some recent breakthroughs have been made to address the first challenge. Onof and Wang (2020) reformulated the equations of the randomised Bartlett-Lewis rectangular pulse (BLRP) models and showed that the improved models can well preserving rainfall extremes at sub-hourly (5- and 10-min) and hourly timescales. The second challenge is however yet to be explored. Cross et al. (2020) recently presented a multivariate regression method that associates BLRP parameters to temperature estimates on a monthly basis, attempting to capture the dynamics of the underlying climate. However, the concept of ""calendar month"" - an artificial period of time - was still employed to represent natural seasonality. This may fail capturing the natural shift and length difference of seasons between years. To address the above drawback, it is critical to ""relax"" the concept of calendar month, so that the most similar climate conditions between different years can be better identified. An innovative approach is proposed in this work to circumvent the above drawback, where two main improvements are implemented. First, instead of following calendar month, we slice the original rainfall time series using an overlapping moving window with 30-day window width and 10-day step size. This enables a stronger continuity in representing climate variations. Second, the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm is employed to quantify the similarity of climate conditions between different years. DTW is a widely-used algorithm in measuring the similarity between two time series, and is known to be less sensitive to the distortion in time axis as compared to the Euclidean distance metrics. Then, based upon DTW measures, we can identify the historical periods with the most similar climate conditions to the target ones. The statistical properties of the local gauge data for these specific periods are used to build the BLRP model in a dynamic fashion. Selected atmospheric variables (including geopotential, temperature, U-component of wind, and V-component of wind ) from the ERA5 re-analysis datasets and five-minute rainfall data from 6 long recording rain gauges in Germany (one with 69 years of data; others with 49 years) are used to test the impact of the proposed approach. Preliminary results show that the statistical behaviours of newly identified periods of data are more analogous to the target period as compared to those identified from the traditional method relying on calendar month. This demonstrates the potential to use the proposed new approach to better incorporating the impact of climate change into stochastic rainfall time series modelling.</p>",2021

Due to the topographic effect and the constant humidity brought by the sea breeze, together with the high temperature, south Taipei is a hotspot for the occurrence of thunderstorms in summer. The monitoring network constitutes a collocated pair of an OTT Pluvio S and an OTT Pluvio L weighing rain gauges, as well as two ""unconventional"" rain sensors - an OTT Parsivel2 disdrometer and a Lufft WS100 radar precipitation sensor. These rain sensors are co-located within a 10 x 10 m2 area, providing rainfall estimates at high temporal resolutions, ranging from 10 seconds to 1 minute.Since the launch of the monitoring network in March 2021, the monitoring network has collected rainfall data for two typhoons and a number of thunderstorms, with the highest peak intensity at 245.6 mm/h. The measurements are generally consistent between four sensors; in particular, those from two weighing gauges are of the highest consistency. In addition, a  preliminary comparison shows that the high-intensity rainfall measured by weighing gauges and disdrometer are in high agreement. This suggests that weighing gauges -which were widely used as a verification gauge for the tipping bucket gauges in the operational context- can provide reliable rainfall measurements with high accuracy, including capturing extreme rainfall.  As compared to other sensors, WS100 tends to underestimate rainfall at high intensities. However, it is more sensitive to low-intensity rainfall than others; and, similarly to the disdrometer, it provides reflectivity data and requires less maintenance. The cause of underestimation is currently under investigation, which could potentially be improved through the calibration of the current algorithm with weighing gauges' measurements. At the next stage of the work, these ground measurements will be compared with the coincidental three-dimensional radar data product from the Central Weather Bureau (CWB), Taiwan. The radar data product from CWB is available at approximately 1.2 km spatial resolution and 10-min intervals. The comparison result will be presented, and the potential of using the monitoring network to support the correction of radar data will be discussed.</p>",2022

It had been used for daily and hourly stochastic rainfall time series modelling for over 30 years. It was however known to underestimate sub-hourly rainfall extremes until some recent advances, where this shortcoming has been overcome. It could therefore serve as an alternative to the existing rainfall frequency analysis methods based upon, for example, annual maxima time series.The implementation of the BL model is however a non-trivial task. The formulation of the BL model is of high complexity, and the calibration of the model parameters constitutes a nonlinear optimisation process with high numerical instability. This hinders the widespread use of the BL model. Another computational challenge of BL modelling lies in sampling. In particular, when using this type of rainfall generators, it often requires sampling a large number of long-term realisations.In this work, with the purpose of promoting BL model and of demonstrating its capacity in modelling sub-hourly rainfall (both standard and extreme statistics), we have initiated an open source Python library for the BL model: pyBL, where a set of data structures and algorithms are designed specifically for the BL model, making the fitting and sampling processes more efficient and lightweight in terms of memory. In particular, one of our designs is a lossless time series compression method that perfectly suits BL model and a set of algorithms and can calculate statistical properties without any decompression. Additionally, we have implemented user interfaces and packaging at various levels, making experimental adjustments and optimisation methods more flexible and concise.Finally, two scientific experiments resembling real-world scenarios were conducted here to demonstrate pyBL's capacity of modelling sub-hourly rainfall extremes with short records, as well as flexibility of utilising records at various resolutions and with various data lengths. We show that, with the help from the BL model, we can well model hourly and sub-hourly rainfall extremes with merely half data length required by the widely-used Annual Maxima method.</p>",2024

Double Trace Moment (DTM) is a technique that helps estimate parameters for the UM model. Based upon the estimated UM parameters, a discrete random cascade process can be used to generate samples with realistic rainfall properties. UM parameters are of physical meanings, representing the levels of mean intermittence (C1) and the changing rate of the mean intermittency deviating from the average field (α, know as the multifractality index), respectively. Therefore, these parameters are also widely used to characterise rainfall features across scales. UM has been tested in many countries under various weather conditions. However, its applications to extreme storm events, such as typhoons, are limited. In light of this, this study intends to analyse UM's capacity of capturing and modelling extreme storm events recorded by a rainfall monitoring network in the South of Taipei City. On the roof of the Civil Engineering Research Building at National Taiwan University, an innovative extreme rainfall monitoring campaign has been set up and collecting high-quality rainfall measurements at fine timescales over the past two years. Rainfall data from several extreme rainfall events, including four typhoons and 10+ thunderstorms, has been collected. In this work, high-resolution rainfall time series from the laser disdrometer for typhoon Nalgae is used for analysis. Rainfall measurements are first aggregated from the native 10-second resolution to 80-second and coarser resolution and then downscaled back to 10-second to verify the downscaling results. The UM analysis is conducted in three different ways. The first way is to apply UM analysis to the entire time series. The resulting parameters are  α = 1.32 and C1 = 0.108. Then, the time series is equally divided into 16 sections such that the temporal variations in rainfall features can be observed. Similarly to the first way, the second way applies the 'standard' UM analysis but to each section. This leads to  α ranging from 1.1 to 1.9 and C1 from 0.05 to 0.18. Finally, the third way applies 'ensemble' UM analysis that concatenates divided sections into a single matrix. This results in  α = 1.55 and C1 = 0.125. The derived parameters are then used to sample 10-second rainfall estimates with a discrete cascade process. The performance is quantified based upon the capacity of preserving observed extreme features. We first analyse the ranges of  α  and C1 resulting from the samples downscaled from the first and the third ways. We can see that the resulting  α  ranging from 1.2 to 1.8 and C1 from 0.06 to 0.16, which fails resembling the aforementioned variability of the UM parameters (i.e. 1.1-1.9 and 0.05-0.18). In fact, only the second way leads to satisfactory result. This preliminary study suggests that typhoon rainfall experiences drastic behaviour changes within a short period, which requires a more 'dynamic' way to model these changes well. Similar analyses will be conducted over other collected typhoons and thunderstorm events to see if the findings can be generalised.</p>",2023

A widely used framework to properly handle these features is Universal Multifractals (UM), which is a physically based and mathematically robust framework. It relies on three parameters, meaning it is parsimonious. Two types of multifractal phase transitions can affect the analysis of a series: (i) the divergence of moments, which is related to the singular limit of the underlying cascade process at small scales and notably explains the power law fall-off observed on numerous geophysical fields, (ii) sampling limitations, which is related to the fact that great moments cannot be observed on finite series.?This study employs UM to analyse the time series of rainfall intensities observed by the Parsival2 disdrometer at the 10-second resolution from three distinct typhoons over the period of July to October 2022, revealing differences and limitations in their statistical characteristics. It enables us to illustrate the ?two previously mentioned concepts of divergence of moments and sampling limitations and their impact on the analysis of rainfall data. The analysis of typhoon Hinnamnor exhibited limitations due to the sampling dimension, indicating that the current data length was insufficient to capture the multifractal nature of the rainfall events for large moments, reducing the robustness of the analysis for moments greater than 5.43. It reflects sampling limitations, leading to a constrained understanding of extreme events. For typhoon Nalgae, our analysis highlighted the occurrence of divergence of moments, i.e. a limitation associated with a critical moment. As higher-order moments were calculated, we observed statistical values tending towards infinity, suggesting that extreme rainfall events significantly influenced this typhoon and pointing out the inadequacy of traditional statistical methods in such scenarios. Such multifractal phase transition is seldom observed on individual series, highlighting the interest of studying this typhoon series.? Finally, the analysis of the typhoon Nesat presented a behavior affected by both multifractal phase transitions resulting in a more complex interpretation.? Our findings provide new insights into the multifractal analysis of typhoon rainfall intensities, emphasising the importance of considering multifractal theory and its associated phase transitions when dealing with natural phenomenon data. These discoveries lay a crucial methodological foundation for more accurate prediction and response to extreme weather events. In case of rainfall, it then has some hydrological consequences notably in terms of stormwater management or optimization of dams for hydraulic production.</p>",2024

There are two primary sources uncertainty while using radar-based nowcasts for hydrological applications. The first one lies in nowcasting algorithm itself; for example, inaccurately predicted rainfall magnitudes and rainfield advection displacement errors, both exacerbated as the lead time increases. The second one is the ""measurement"" error. There is a notable discrepancy between radar-derived precipitation estimates and measurements from rain gauges, underscoring the inherent uncertainties, including systematic and random errors, in radar data. This discrepancy necessitates aligning indirect radar measurements with actual ground-level precipitation for practical hydrological applications and analyses.In this study, we focus on tackling the ""measurement"" uncertainty, such that the applicability of ensemble nowcasts to hydrological practices can be improved. In the proposed method, rain gauge observations are treated as the ground truth. The Censored and Shifted Gamma Distribution (CSGD) model is then constructed using these gauge data and the co-located radar rainfall estimates. The use of CSGD model lies in its ability to not only condition actual rainfall estimates on radar data values but also account for precipitation climatology at gauge locations. Based on the CSGD parameters at know locations, we can further interpolate parameters for any locations within our study domain. We then employed the STEPS (Short-Term Ensemble Prediction System) to generate radar-based ensemble nowcasts, which are then adjusted at each radar pixel locations using CSGD model with the corresponding parameters. This leads to CSGD-enhanced ensemble nowcasts.The United Kingdom, with its comprehensive weather data, served as the experimental area for this study. The 1-km UK C-band radar composite from the Met Office Nimrod System and the Met Office Integrated Data Archive System (MIDAS) gauge data were utilised. By aggregating these datasets into hourly scales, climatological and conditional CSGD parameters from 2015 to 2020 were estimated. The evaluation involved two stage. Initially, about 10% of rain gauges were excluded from the CSGD model fitting, with parameters estimated via Kriging interpolation. This is to ensure the quality of interpolated CSGD parameters. Then, a total of 30 storm events from 2021 to 2023 were selected to test the proposed method. Preliminary results show that the CSGD-enhanced ensemble nowcasts show a higher agreement with rain gauge observations as compared to the original nowcasts.The proposed method is of great practical potential to provide not only timely but also enhanced precipitation nowcasts to critical hydrological applications, such as landslide or flooding warnings.</p>",2024

A state-of-the-art storm tracking algorithm was employed to reconstruct convective cell lifecycles within each selected event. The investigation of these cell lifecycles proceeded in three stages.

Despite increasing awareness and investment in river water quality monitoring worldwide, current monitoring strategies fail to well characterise river health. In particular, the spatial and temporal resolution at which river health is currently monitored is insufficient and falls short to identify e.g., pollution spikes and point pollution sources. At the same time, the rise in citizen engagement in river monitoring, driven by increased awareness and widespread availability of smart phones and other monitoring technologies, has generated opportunities to overcome current monitoring barriers. In this paper, we share our experience collaborating with the community group Friends of Bradford's Becks (FoBB, UK) to use citizen-collected photos for AI-based detection of health indicators, leading to enhanced river health management. More specifically, FoBB has collected around 100,000 photos of the streams that flow through and under Bradford. These images offer insights into the health of the becks, including specific pollution issues such as discharging overflows, sewage litter, discolouration, amongst other things, as well as how pollution has changed in time and space. The number of photos makes analysis challenging. In this project, we used AI models for automatic image labelling and prototyped several landing solutions for embedding the labelling model into a tool usable by citizens. The project was initially set up in a Hackathon, funded by Natural England, and aimed to develop solutions using AI models. The landing solutions employed classification and object detection deep learning models to assist citizens by offering automatic detection of river health indicators. This not only reduces the cost of reporting but also improves the quality of reporting with comprehensive labels. Through community engagement, high spatio-temporal resolution data can be collected from citizens to fill the data gaps, including pollution levels, natural habitat conditions, and biodiversity. Additionally, while collecting the data, the deep learning models can be further fine-tuned to better assist citizens and managers in river health assessment and management. In summary, the project presents a holistic approach to river health management, combining the strengths of AI with the insights and engagement of local communities. The success of this approach in Bradford offers a template for similar initiatives globally, marking a step towards more informed and responsive river health management strategies.</p>",2024

Currently, most existing object-based nowcasting methods primarily focus on predicting cell movements, neglecting the temporal evolution of cell properties such as size, shape, and intensity. Incorporating this evolution is critical for improving predictability in convective storms. While previous studies have used three-dimensional (3D) radar observations to capture vertical changes during convective cell formation, these efforts often analyse or reconstruct specific convective events. Integrating 3D radar information into operational object-based radar rainfall nowcasting remains an open challenge. This research addresses this challenge using deep learning (DL) techniques. More specifically, a DL-based prediction model is developed, which uses 2D and 3D cells' properties retrieved from 3D radar reflectivity data at the current time and across the past 15 min to predict the evolution of these properties over the next 15 min. This model could eventually be integrated into existing object-based nowcasting models. A total of 4708 cell lifecycles, extracted from high-resolution (5-min, 1-km, 24 levels at 0.5 km intervals) 3D radar data across the UK, are used to train the model, and a total of 1177 lifecycles are used for testing. The proposed model is shown to predict the evolution of single-core convective cells effectively, including changes in 2D projected geometry and mean 2D and 3D reflectivity. In particular, by incorporating information on the vertical evolution of convective cores, the prediction errors of mean reflectivity (in both 2D and 3D) can be reduced by approximately 50% at 15-min forecast lead time, as compared to a persistence forecast.

Water quality is difficult to observe at high spatial and temporal resolutions; it is costly and typically requires trained specialists in the field and in laboratories. However, the rise in citizen science monitoring has generated opportunities to overcome many barriers and fill data gaps. Citizens want access to actionable water quality information that can provide early warnings and drive change. Our bibliographic analysis emphasises that citizen science is rarely paired with the use of continuous sensors, and many monitoring schemes involving the public are unable to offer the detail required. This study has explored the practicalities and competencies associated with community-led (near) continuous water quality monitoring (CWQM), and has generated an extensive checklist containing technical, social, economic, and wider responsibilities that stakeholders should consider. The °ßUpStream°® project has provided a testbed for this exploratory work and the development and deployment of the °ßWaterBox°® CWQM device. Case studies from the UK and Taiwan, where community-led CWQM programmes have been piloted, have provided novel methodological insights. Lessons learnt have enabled researchers to determine whether, and to what extent, community-led CWQM is achievable in practice. Results confirm that 75% of the practicalities observed fall under the °ßtechnical°® category, despite offering a social and inclusive methodology. Through observational work, it was found that only 34% of the 104 practicalities were led by community groups and community champions. Communities require significant support owing to the sheer number of technical barriers, although some of this could be provided by skilled community champions. These findings have surfaced despite the WaterBox equipment being open, accessible, cost-effective, and adaptable. Unless support is in place and/or technology significantly evolves to reduce the number of challenges, it is unlikely that communities will lead and take full ownership of CWQM programmes. Despite this, the generation of site-specific CWQM data are welcomed by citizens, who can co-design schemes, interpret trends and offer valuable local information that trained scientists cannot achieve alone. These transferable findings are relevant to monitoring initiatives across the environmental sector.</p>",2024
